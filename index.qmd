Hello, I'm Kevin Horrell! I'm studying water resources and data science at Colorado State University. I love learning about water, where we get it, and how to keep those sources clean and thriving. Besides that, I run, play volleyball when I can, and bake sourdough bread. Check out my website to learn more about me!
