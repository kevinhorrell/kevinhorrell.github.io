Hello, I'm Kevin Horrell! I'm a professional master's student studying water resource management and data science at Colorado State University. I love learning about water, where it comes from, it's chemical and physical properties, how it interacts with the environment, and how to sustain it in the urban and natural environments. Aside from my career and educational interests, I try to enjoy all Colorado has to offer. I run, hike, camp, ski, play volleyball, paddleboard and bake sourdough bread. Check out my website to learn more about me!
